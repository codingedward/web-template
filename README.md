## Web Template

Tired of setting up a new Node & React app all the time? Well, I am.

This is a boilerplate with:

1. NextJS - Cool ReactJS SSRed framework (and alot more!).
2. TypeORM - A TypeScript based ORM.
3. TypeGraphQL - A TypeScript based GraphQL schema definition library.
4. Apollo Server - GraphQL server.
5. Apollo Client - GraphQL client.
6. Redux - Sane state management.
7. Docker - For local development.

This is still a work in progress and mostly meant for personal use. Feel free to fork or/and raise a PR if you'd like to!
